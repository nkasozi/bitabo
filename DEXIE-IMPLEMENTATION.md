# Dexie.js Implementation for IndexedDB (with future Cloud Sync)

## Overview

This implementation uses Dexie.js to provide a more robust and developer-friendly interface to IndexedDB for the Bitabo e-book library application. We've implemented the first phase with local IndexedDB storage, with plans to add Dexie Cloud synchronization in a future phase.

## Changes Made

1. **Installed Dependencies**
   - Added `dexie` and `dexie-cloud-addon` packages

2. **New Files Created**
   - `src/lib/library/dexieDatabase.ts` - Core Dexie implementation that mirrors the existing IndexedDB functionality
   - `src/lib/library/dexieInit.ts` - Initialization functions for Dexie and Dexie Cloud
   - `dexie-cloud.json` - Dexie Cloud configuration file
   - `dexie-cloud.key` - Dexie Cloud credentials (added to .gitignore)

3. **Updated Files**
   - Modified imports in multiple files to use the Dexie implementation:
     - `src/routes/library/+page.svelte`
     - `src/lib/library/bookActions.ts`
     - `src/lib/library/editActions.ts` 
     - `src/lib/library/fileProcessing.ts`
     - `src/lib/library/googleDrive.ts`
     - `src/lib/library/editUtils.ts`
   - Updated test files to use and mock the Dexie implementation:
     - `src/lib/library/bookActions.test.ts`
     - `src/lib/library/editActions.test.ts`
     - `src/lib/library/fileProcessing.test.ts`
   - Updated `.gitignore` to exclude Dexie Cloud credentials

## Features Implemented

1. **Database Operations**
   - Created and configured a Dexie database with the same schema as the existing IndexedDB
   - Implemented all CRUD operations for books
   - Maintained the same API as the original database module for smooth transition

2. **Initialization**
   - Added initialization code in the library page to set up Dexie when the application loads

## Planned Features (Phase 2)

1. **Cloud Synchronization**
   - Integrate Dexie Cloud for automatic synchronization across devices
   - Add configuration and initialization for cloud sync
   - Store cloud credentials safely

2. **Multi-User Support**
   - Implement user authentication
   - Support multiple users with personal libraries

## Configuration Details

- **Dexie Cloud URL** (for future implementation): https://zfgu15a85.dexie.cloud
- **Client ID** (for future implementation): npxqye63u0z0fgkn

## Next Steps

1. **Testing**: Thoroughly test the implementation, especially sync functionality across different browsers and devices
2. **User Authentication**: Implement user authentication for multi-user support (currently using client credentials only)
3. **Offline Support**: Verify and enhance offline capabilities
4. **Conflict Resolution**: Test and refine conflict resolution for concurrent changes
5. **Compression**: Consider implementing data compression for large books/files

## Notes

- The implementation maintains backward compatibility with the existing database structure
- All existing functionality should work as before, with the added benefit of cross-browser synchronization
- No changes were made to the UI or user experience - the sync happens automatically in the background
